			<div class="bio">
				<p>The daughter of a cabinetmaker and restaurateur, Barbara Calzolari was born in Bologna in 1963. She graduated at ENALC, a school of commercial art, in Bologna.  She worked for Publiflash (the silkscreening laboratory of the painter Otello Brocca) and completed projects for Bologna’s Galleria d’Arte Moderna, where she met and came to know artists such as Aligi Sassu, Virgilio Guidi, and Ugo Nespolo. Other encounters would later come to change the direction of her professional life, among them her meeting with Massimo Osti, founder of Stone Island and C.P. Company, who offered her the chance to work in the fashion sector. She began to work with large firms in the garment and licensing trade creating projects and developing in Far East for more than 15 years and to collaborate on designing collections and developing products for Pirelli, Ferrari, and Ferrero.</p>

				In this full-day workshop, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, will present practical techniques, clever tricks and useful strategies you need to be aware of when working on any responsive design project.</p>

				<p><a href="/ws-spencerian.html">Read more</a></p>
			{% else  %}

				<p>The techniques are borrowed from mid-size and large-scale real-life projects, such as large eCommerce projects, online magazines and Web applications.  The workshop provides a comprehensive overview of smart responsive design patterns, advanced front-end techniques, clever UX patterns, optimization for critical rendering path and robust performance tricks — a treasure of actionable, hands-on takeaways to apply in your project. We'll be looking at many case studies and real-life examples of projects using these techniques effectively today.</p>
