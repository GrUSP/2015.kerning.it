			<p class="intro">At the beginning of the last Century polyhedric artists were used to visualize simple thoughts or sensations combining
				etching and letterpress and giving them the shape of a little book. Faenza was one of the most artist's books productive
				centres all over Europe because it of its many pottery decorators, engravers and print makers.</p>

			{% if page.short %}
				<p><a href="/ws-letterpress.html">Read more</a></p>
			{% else  %}

				<p>You will have quick but really fully immersive experience in etching and letterpress, learning different techniques and
				procedures in order to make some copies of your own handmade book.</p>


				<p>Enrico Versari and Alberto Zannoni will follow you step by step helping you to: develop your ideas from drawings into
					an engraved copper plate; transmute it in a printing plate thanks to an acid bath in aqua fortis - the term used by
					ancient alchemists to define the active ingredient able to govern the transformative process of the substance;
					reproduce it in series using a printing press by hands.</p>

				<div><img src="/img/TheArtistsPictures2.jpg" class="sponsor-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-title="The Artist's Book" data-original-title="The Artist's Book" title="The Artist's Book"></div>

				<p>Then Damiano Bandini will help you to compose properly your text (140-character limit, just like a twit) using original Art Nouveau or Futurism woodcut block-prints made by local artists and Italian lead-types of the 40s, 50s and 60s.</p>
				<p>This is a rare opportunity to see a printmaker using an old and noisy Heidelberg Platina or a really loud Nebiolo printing press; to smell the inky air of the same poky workshop, La Vecchia Stamperia, where that machine has been operating since 1920, providing the first town newspaper.</p>

				<p>REQUIRED SKILL: drawing basics</p>
				<p>MATERIALS: pencil, fine cotton-paper, ink and acid,  will be provided by the KERNING Crew.</p>
				<p>BEWARE OF INK: Please, take an apron with you or, at least, an old T-shirt!</p>
