		<div class="title">An introduction to the world of Calligraphy</div>
		<div class="abstract">
			<p class="intro">An introduction to the exterminated world of handwriting and his tools through the works of Luca Barcellona, who made of contemporary calligraphy his personal mission and lifestyle.</p>
			<p>Street signs, packaging, wine labels, logotypes, tattoos and advertising: calligraphy today is still is everywhere, but how we can recognize a well done lettering?</p>
<p>Calligraphy is helpful for every graphic designer and type designer, and is something that everyone should know for his visual culture.</p>
<p>The Humanistic script is the basis for many typefaces we use nowadays, as the letters written with the broad edge pen, reported in auge by Johnston in the early 19th century with his Foundational.</p>
<p>Roman Capitals are our model of beauty in letterforms, in two thousand years they survived to all fashion styles, and is where the serifs came from.</p>
<p>We will try to rewrite these letterforms and compose a small text (working on interlinear space and kerning). </p>
<p>A "Drawing Kit" will be provided. The kit will include a Parallel stroke pen, ink refill, drawing sheets, pencils, thin marker, glue.</p>
