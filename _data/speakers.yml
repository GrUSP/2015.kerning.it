  title: The Digital/Analog Flip-Flop
  abstract: "Words are vessels of thought and culture. As our words jump from screen to page, medium to medium, it becomes a designer’s task to develop design approaches and typographic systems that can elegantly retain their integrity from place to place, while using each format’s advantages. Content moves in both directions we can use the connectivity of digital to invigorate printed material, but also use the uniformity of the printed page to stabilize digital content. It’s a difficult task, but we have examples. I’ll track patterns back into television, documentaries, and paperbacks to look for clues about how to take advantage of this decade’s big design opportunity."

  title: Writing is no longer enough
  abstract: As designers we are living the most interesting and challenging age of the news industry. The technology used in writing is undergoing a huge transformation, addressing itself to a multitude of languages. The great challenge of our time is to combine different languages, in order to increase knowledge and understanding, to inform and clarify. According to Franchi, reporting is not merely filing a story once, but rather telling a continuous narrative in a way that is most relevant for a broad range of traditional and digital media—from breaking news to analysis, from interviews to commentaries, from photo essays and illustrations to information graphics and interactive visualizations of data.
