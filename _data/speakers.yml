  title: Recapturing the Essence of Hand-drawn Lettering Through Typeface Design
  abstract: "What makes a script typeface look natural, organic, authentic? It’s not the style, the curves, the simplicity, or the complexity. It is the imperfections. It’s natural to want to tame these flaws when creating a typeface, but it is these very imperfections that give the design its feel of humanity. How far do we go with our 'fixes?' What are the other challenges and considerations when designing a script typeface and what options are available to the designer and end-user to achieve the desired look of authenticity? In this talk, I will take you through my personal journey of typeface design and how I’ve answered these questions and more."

  title: Improving Web Fonts Performance
  abstract: "When it comes to Web fonts, loading time can be quite a headache.

In this talk, Vitaly will be talking about a few strategies and a few practical techniques to deliver content faster, load Web fonts faster and deal with them across both modern and legacy browsers in mobile and desktop devices."

  title: "Architecting Information"
  abstract: "For developers, the motivation to build so called 'Multi Tier' system architectures is to physically separate the main parts of the system. This allows upgrading or replacing any part of its structure without having to change the whole setup. The most common variant is the three tier architecture that differenciates between presentation, logic and data. iA uses a similar approach for creating information systems. In his speech Oliver will explore the role of typography in multi tier information architecture."
